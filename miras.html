          <p><b>The Bosnia and Herzegovina</b> national football represents Bosnia and Herzegovina in international football competitions, and is governed by the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until 1992, Bosnian footballers played for Yugoslavia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved their best result when they reached the 2014 FIFA World Cup as winners of their qualifying group. They were eliminated after narrow group stage losses to Argentina and Nigeria and a win over Iran.
The national team has appeared in numerous other qualification play-offs, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup play-offs loss to Portugal, as well as the qualifying play-offs for UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016, losing to Portugal and the Republic of Ireland respectively, preventing the team from reaching their first UEFA European Championship.
Their two home stadiums are Bilino Polje in Zenica and Grbavica in Sarajevo. The team's highest FIFA World Ranking was 13th, achieved in August 2013.

<p>The Bosnian national team has more recently begun to use Stadion Grbavica, located in Sarajevo, for its home games, following a renovation in 2018.  The second of the two main stadiums of the national football team of Bosnia and Herzegovina is Bilino Polje, located in the city of Zenica. The stadium was built and opened in 1972, and is used to host matches of a more intimate atmosphere. On 10 August 2012, the Bosnian Association and the local government of City of Zenica financed the replacement of the old grass surface at the Bilino Polje Stadium. Another stadium Bosnia has used is City Stadium Koševo, also known as Olympic Stadium Koševo, for some of its games. Its training ground for domestic matches is the N/FSBIH Training Center in Zenica, which was opened in 2013 in conjunction with UEFA. A popular nickname of all Bosnian sport teams and/or sportsman is "Zmajevi" (Bosnian: zmajevi, lit. 'dragons'), popularized by football TV commentator Mustafa Mijajlović during Belgium vs. Bosnia (2-4) 2010 WC qualification game on 28 March 2009. </p>
